## the instructino string will go something like '1920 agd sexual 1920 arf sexual'
## we instruct GNU parallel to run 6 jobs in parallel and 
## use 2 or 3 elements from the string for the command
## so the first parallel job will go './gyrosim.py 1920 agd'
## the second parallel job will go './gyrosim.py 1920 arf' and so on
parallel --tagstring {2} --jobs 6 -N2 ./gyrosim.py {1} {2} ::: $instructions > outputs/simulations.sexual-False.log

CHeck out how the simulated populations exlore haplotype space:

Create a txt file containing all possible genotypes and haplotype combinations for a total of 10 loci.
```bash
./create_all_possible_hts.py 10
```

Find the reproductive mode that covers the complete haplotype space the fastest.
e.g.:
```bash
./gyrosim.py 1920 arf sexual 10 #run for 1920 hours, second and subsequent births are per default arf; third birth can be sexual; genome has 10 variable loci; This will, at the end of the run automatically read in a file 'hts.txt' which contains the possible haplotypes, remove the ones that have been covered in the current run and write the remaining back to the file.
```

To simulate 10 fish and see how many haplotypes have not yet been covered. The number of parasites per fish needs to be specified in the script.
```bash
./create_all_possible_hts.py 10
#this would run 10 consecutive simulations (10 fish) and for each subtract the haplotypes that have been explored from all possible at the end of each simulation
for i in {01..10}; do echo -e "$i"; ./gyrosim.py 1920 atf sexual 10; done
```
